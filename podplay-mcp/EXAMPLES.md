```bash
receive_file("improved-config.yaml", "./config/")
```

## üìÑ Document Processing

### Scenario: PDF Report Generation

**You**: "I have raw data that needs to be formatted into a professional report."

```bash
send_file("./data/quarterly-metrics.json", "Raw quarterly metrics data")
send_file("./templates/report-template.docx", "Company report template")
```

**AI**: I'll process your data and create a formatted report...

```bash
list_transfer_files()  # Check available files
receive_file("quarterly-metrics.json", "/tmp/processing/")
receive_file("report-template.docx", "/tmp/processing/")
```

**AI**: Report generated! Here's your professional quarterly report:

```bash
send_file("/tmp/output/Q4-2024-Report.pdf", "Complete formatted quarterly report")
```

## üîß System Administration

### Scenario: Log File Analysis

**You**: "My server logs are showing some unusual patterns. Can you analyze them?"

```bash
send_file("/var/log/nginx/access.log", "Nginx access logs from today")
send_file("/var/log/app/errors.log", "Application error logs")
```

**AI**: I'll analyze your logs for patterns and security issues...

```bash
receive_file("access.log", "/tmp/log-analysis/")
receive_file("errors.log", "/tmp/log-analysis/")
```

**AI**: Analysis complete! I found several patterns of concern. Here's a detailed security report:

```bash
send_file("/tmp/reports/security-analysis.txt", "Detailed security analysis and recommendations")
```

## üéì Educational Content

### Scenario: Learning Material Exchange

**Teacher**: "I have homework assignments that need to be distributed to students."

```bash
send_file("./assignments/week-5-python-exercises.pdf", "Python programming exercises for week 5")
send_file("./assignments/starter-code.zip", "Starter code template files")
```

**Student**: "I've completed my assignment. Here's my submission:"

```bash
send_file("./completed/student-solution.py", "My completed Python assignment")
```

**AI Tutor**: Let me review your submission...

```bash
receive_file("student-solution.py", "/tmp/grading/")
```

## üîÑ Backup & Archive

### Scenario: File Organization

**You**: "I need to organize and backup important files."

```bash
# Send multiple files for organization
send_file("./documents/contract-2024.pdf", "Important contract document")
send_file("./photos/family-vacation.zip", "Family photos archive")
send_file("./code/project-backup.tar.gz", "Source code backup")
```

**AI**: I'll help organize these files into a proper backup structure...

```bash
list_transfer_files()  # Review all files
# AI processes and creates organized structure
send_file("/tmp/organized/2024-backup-organized.zip", "Organized backup with proper folder structure")
```

## ü§ù Team Collaboration

### Scenario: Multi-Person Project

**Team Lead**: "I'm sharing the project specification with the team."

```bash
send_file("./specs/project-requirements-v2.docx", "Updated project requirements")
```

**Developer**: "I've completed the API documentation."

receive_file("project-requirements-v2.docx", "./design-refs/")
send_file("./mockups/ui-design-final.fig", "Final UI design mockups")
```

## üí° Creative Automation

### Scenario: Batch File Processing

**You**: "I have 50 images that need resizing and optimization."

```bash
# Send batch of images
for file in ./photos/*.jpg; do
  send_file("$file", "Photo for batch processing")
done
```

**AI**: I'll process all images and optimize them...

```bash
list_transfer_files()  # See all uploaded images
# AI processes each image
# Creates optimized versions
send_file("/tmp/optimized/optimized-photos.zip", "All photos resized and optimized")
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Safe File Handling Examples

```bash
# Always check file info before processing
get_file_info("unknown-file.exe")

# Clean up after processing
delete_transfer_file("temporary-data.tmp")

# List files regularly to monitor transfer directory
list_transfer_files()
```

## üìà Performance Tips

### Efficient Transfer Strategies

1. **Large Files**: Split into chunks if over size limit
2. **Multiple Files**: Use archives (zip/tar) when possible
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Delete processed files to save space
4. **File Info**: Check file details before downloading

```bash
# Example: Handling large dataset
# Split large file into chunks
split -b 50M large-dataset.csv dataset-chunk-

# Send chunks individually
send_file("dataset-chunk-aa", "Dataset part 1 of 3")
send_file("dataset-chunk-ab", "Dataset part 2 of 3")
send_file("dataset-chunk-ac", "Dataset part 3 of 3")
```

These examples show the versatility and power of the File Transfer MCP Server for various workflows! üöÄ
