🚩 Essential Reusable UI Components
Here's an example of production-level significantly-used reusable component architecture & templates:

✅ CollapsiblePanel Component (production-ready template)
interface CollapsiblePanelProps {
  title: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  defaultOpen?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

/**
 * CollapsiblePanel - Smooth collapsible UI element, great for menus or compact view toggling.
 */
export const CollapsiblePanel = React.memo<CollapsiblePanelProps>(
  ({ title, icon, defaultOpen = true, children }) => {
    const [isOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(defaultOpen);

    const toggleOpen = React.useCallback(() => setOpen((prev) => !prev), []);

    return (
      <section className="bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg p-3 shadow-md">
        <header
          className="flex items-center cursor-pointer select-none"
          onClick={toggleOpen}
          aria-expanded={isOpen}
        >
          {icon && <span className="mr-2">{icon}</span>}
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold flex-grow">{title}</h3>
          <span>{isOpen ? <ChevronUpIcon /> : <ChevronDownIcon />}</span>
        </header>
        <AnimatePresence>
          {isOpen && (
            <motion.div
              initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
              animate={{ height: 'auto', opacity: 1 }}
              exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
              transition={{ duration: 0.4, ease: [0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1] }}
              className="overflow-hidden"
            >
              <div className="py-2">{children}</div>
            </motion.div>
          )}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </section>
    );
  }
);

CollapsiblePanel.displayName = 'CollapsiblePanel';
interface CollapsiblePanelProps {
  title: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  defaultOpen?: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

/**
 * CollapsiblePanel - Smooth collapsible UI element, great for menus or compact view toggling.
 */
export const CollapsiblePanel = React.memo<CollapsiblePanelProps>(
  ({ title, icon, defaultOpen = true, children }) => {
    const [isOpen, setOpen] = React.useState(defaultOpen);

    const toggleOpen = React.useCallback(() => setOpen((prev) => !prev), []);

    return (
      <section className="bg-neutral-800 rounded-lg p-3 shadow-md">
        <header
          className="flex items-center cursor-pointer select-none"
          onClick={toggleOpen}
          aria-expanded={isOpen}
        >
          {icon && <span className="mr-2">{icon}</span>}
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold flex-grow">{title}</h3>
          <span>{isOpen ? <ChevronUpIcon /> : <ChevronDownIcon />}</span>
        </header>
        <AnimatePresence>
          {isOpen && (
            <motion.div
              initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
              animate={{ height: 'auto', opacity: 1 }}
              exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}
              transition={{ duration: 0.4, ease: [0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1] }}
              className="overflow-hidden"
            >
              <div className="py-2">{children}</div>
            </motion.div>
          )}
        </AnimatePresence>
      </section>
    );
  }
);

CollapsiblePanel.displayName = 'CollapsiblePanel';
✅ ResizablePanel Component (production-ready template)
Using react-resizable-panels:

import { Panel, PanelGroup, PanelResizeHandle } from 'react-resizable-panels';

<PanelGroup autoSaveId="myPanels" direction="horizontal">
  <Panel minSize={20} defaultSize={25}>
    {/* Left Sidebar */}
  </Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle className="bg-black/20 hover:bg-accent transition-colors cursor-col-resize w-1" />
  <Panel minSize={30}>
    {/* Main Content Area */}
  </Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle className="bg-black/20 hover:bg-accent transition-colors cursor-col-resize w-1" />
  <Panel minSize={20}>
    {/* Right Sidebar */}
  </Panel>
</PanelGroup>
